# Polchatex (client)

Front end client for a simple websocket-based web chat, built using Angular 6 and Bootstrap 4.

(you might also want to take a look at the [Java-based backend](https://github.com/developol/polchatex-server)

## Live on heroku!
The whole application is fully functional and deployed on Heroku, on 

**https://polchatex.herokuapp.com**

(you might have to wait a while, as it's using free hosting and might be put to sleep)

## Features

* account registration/login
* real time conversations with other users
* private and group chats!
* message history stored in database, ready for viewing (size limited due to, again, free hosting)
